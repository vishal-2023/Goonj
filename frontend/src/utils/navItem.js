It disturbed Anshu that despite being a basic human need, cloth was nowhere in the development agenda. This attention to a neglected basic need set him on 24+ years of transforming India’s culture of giving of our unused cloth and other under-utilised material for development work.Under Anshu’s leadership, Goonj has taken the alarming growth of urban surplus and instrumentalised it to trigger large-scale rural communities-led development work. While creatively and flexibly matching and seamlessly weaving urban surplus into the changing priorities and realities of rural marginalised communities. Anshu has pioneered the genesis of a parallel surplus-based economy of barter between efforts of rural communities and underutilised material as the two new currencies.<Br/>The Goonj model has emerged as a worldwide case study around deploying surplus material circularity to mobilise large scale civic-engagement-led material poverty alleviation, community dignity and agency-led rural development and rural wisdom-led climate change mitigation work."

We take clothes, household items, stationary, old news papers, one side used paper, furniture, bedding, export surplus, generators, medicines, dry ration, blankets etc. You can refer to the suggestive list of material and certain dos and don’ts around giving.

While there are more than 100 issues being talked about in the development sector, right from domestic violence to global warming, this basic need doesn’t find a mention anywhere.

In case of schools, colleges, other institutions and corporates, since they have the means and the access to their own transportation, we request them to consider the dropping of material as the organization’s contribution towards our work.

Schools have been built, wells have been dug up, and bridges have been built by people under the Cloth for Work initiative.

Also since we give material under Cloth for Work initiative (earlier known as Cloth for Work), we need to partner with a local organization who can connect with the community and bring them together for doing community work. In case of school material or for disasters we still need to know basic information like how many people, age groups, male/female etc details.

        data:"These often-used wise words became a reality when eight residents of Vishwaspur village in Raigarh district of Chhattisgarh, showed their will and determination to solve their water woes, problems regarding infrastructure and cleanliness. There are many instances where lack of adequate water led to crop failure and the hard work of the villagers went in vain. When Team Goonj approached the village and heard the concerns of the villagers, they gave them a proposal on how to address their issues under Goonj’s ‘Dignity For Work’ (DFW) initiative. The residents of Vishwaspur decided to come together to work on these, and immediately after, they started digging the pond. The task became very strenuous as the stones in mud hindered their work, but they didn’t give up. Their hard work paid off when they saw water getting collected in the pond. In just fifteen days, the group constructed a pond, which will help them to irrigate their land properly. After completion of the work, the villagers were rewarded with carefully-made Goonj kits comprising ration and other basic essentials as a token of appreciation for their wisdom and hard work. The multifaceted work done shows the power of determination and collective action… how, with a little motivation, a handful of villagers changed the profile of their habitat, and are now keen to continue the development and community welfare work. The participants said they realized that they do not need to wait for external help to address their problems, as with the right approach and mindset, they know they can do it all by themselves.",

The village housed a well that had been used by generations. However, after being left unattended for nearly half a century, it soon became a dumping ground for garbage and carcasses of animals which often resulted in a stench. When Team Goonj suggested the community to clean the well under Goonj’s ‘Dignity for Work’ (DFW) initiative, the locals were initially reluctant to undertake the cleaning as they were unsure of the result. However, after a few interactions with the team, when they realized that it was their collective responsibility to preserve their resources, 45 residents came forward to clean and restore the well to its former glory. Today, as a result of the activity, the well can be used to store groundwater. Goonj rewarded their efforts with essential kits consisting of ration, mats and other basic essentials. For the people of J. Thimmasandra, this activity proved to be an eye opener, for it made them understand the importance of a clean and healthy environment and the power of collective action.",

However, due to Covid and the following lockdown they are all back and stuck in their homes without any work.“It has become very difficult for us to run our house and as of now, it is not known how long we will have to fight this disaster. Right now we want to do farming for the living and survival of our family, as that is our only means. But we do not have any water source so we depend on rain water only. And even that does not last long. Apart from agriculture we do not have any other option or resources to feed ourselves,” Vinod Kumar Mahto, a local, said.“When Goonj team visited our area, they organized a meeting to discuss our concerns. They told us to make a small pond under their Dignity For Work (DFW) initiative, through which we can save rain water so that people can continue irrigation in the field by using the collected water,” he added.",

        title:'Taking collective responsibility for our problem',
        data:"These are ironic times that we live in.. on the one hand, the country grapples with massive flooding in some states and on the other hand several other states reel under severe drought. Farmers are driven to commit suicide in many regions due to lack of water, failed crops and the burden of unpaid debts. The tribal communities, traditionally considered the ‘receivers’ and ‘beneficiaries’, have been a constant source of wisdom and wellspring of courage and determination in our work. Here is an inspiring story from the remote interiors of tribal India that shows how they took collective responsibility to find solutions for their problems.Back in 2012, a few tribal Korku women from Langoti village in Khalwa block (Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh) had enough of making umpteen requests to the local administration to get water in their village. Summer meant no water here, as the common sources of water dried up and the women had to walk to the lone well outside the village to fetch water 2 or 3 times a day in the scorching heat. Since the men folk went out to work during the day, this distressing and arduous task of carrying upto 3 vessels of water on their heads and balanced on their waists, fell on the women of the house. Tulsi Bai, from the village said, “Even in the scorching summer heat, at noon we have gone to fetch water.” Although there are 12 hand pumps and two tube wells (private) in the entire village.. in summers all water sources dry up, except for this well that serves around 2000 villagers living in the vicinity.Ram Kali Bai from the village said, “When we went with our problem to the CO (Collector officer) of our block, we were told that there are 12 hand pumps and a tube well in your village, there is even a river and a dam, so what’s your problem?” She asked the officials to visit the village personally to understand the reality for himself. This was in April 2012. Something extraordinary was about to happen. Goonj had been working extensively in this region for some time and had already triggered the first well digging under ‘Cloth for Work’ (CFW) in the near by Salidhana village. When the idea reached this village, the women of Langoti knew what they wanted to do. Like Ram Kali Bai, they realised that now it was really up to them to take a strong decisive step to solve their problem.",

        data:"Karnataka; Raichur’s water situation has severely deteriorated in the last few years affecting the local agriculture and animals as well. Families surviving on less than 10 water pots a day are forced to sell their cattle for meagre amounts as they can’t fulfill their water needs.For the people of Mudgal village in Raichur district, their local check dam was their only water source and the one place their rainwater was collected. Goonj’s Karnataka Team mobilized and motivated the villagers to work together and repair their dam. Over 285 people worked tirelessly to locally collect stones to cover the 60 x 60 ft check dam.. all on their own! This much needed repair strengthened the walls of the dam and has increased its life for water collection in the monsoons.",
